# TrtlWear

TrtlWear is a watchface that tells you all the important things you need, like the time, date, weather,
battery, and how much TRTL is trading for.

## What is a TRTL?

TRTL is the short name for TurtleCoin, you can find more info and get involved [from their website](https://turtlecoin.lol/).

## Why is it not showing the trading from 'name your exchange'?

### It will be one of three things:
1. I've not grabbed the API yet. (Check [issues](https://github.com/seperot/TrtlWear/issues) and submit a suggestion if it's not there)
2. They are not trading TRTL yet.
3. They want to charge for their API.

## The watch says 1 TRTL = 1 TRTL rather than a price

While this is always the correct answer, it could be that the app hasn't updated the watch yet (It refreshes in 5 min intervals)
or you could be having network problems. Give it a bit of time and check if you are connected to the internet.

## I like this and I want to shower you in praise

Well I lurk in the [TurtleCoin Discord](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol/) so you can find me there.

I also accept tips!
